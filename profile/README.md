# Bitblik 

BLIK is a popular mobile payment system widely used in Poland, most shops/merchants/ATMs/ecommerce sites accept it.\
It allows users to make payments using a 6-digit code generated by their banking app.\
Thanks to its success in Poland, BLIK has plans to expand into other European countries in near future.\

The fundamental idea of Bitblik is:
- pay with Bitcoin everywhere where BLIK payment is accepted
- buy Bitcoin by generating and selling BLIK codes from your banking app
